# WinUI3-Transparent-Mica-Acrylic-Blurred
 Fully working transparent/mica/acrylic/blurred window for WinUI3.
 
 Since the first preview of WinUi3 version 1.1 you can achieve fully transparent windows with a few Win32 API calls.
 And with even more Win32 APi calls you can actually achieve fully working Mica effect or Acrylic Blur or even just a normal blur.
 
 This example project comes with a fully working TitleBar but you can create a borderless window (just like in WPF) with ```Helpers.Window.Presentor.SetBorderAndTitleBar(false, false);```.
